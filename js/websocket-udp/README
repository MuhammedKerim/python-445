wsnotifier gets JSON strings from UDP port in format
{"id":"123", "message":"hello"}

and sends to all connected websocket clients.
Websocket clients should send a string or list of
strings after connecting to specify their subsriptions. 
Then clients will be sent all notifications coming from
UDP port if message id matches their subscriptions. 
(when a message with id '*' is sent, all ids match)

wsnotifier needs python >= 3.4

running:
./wsnotifier udphost:port websockethost:port




Testing:
./wsnotifier 127.0.0.1:9999 0.0.0.0:5678


load wstest.html from your browser. Enter ids you are interested in.

then in command line 
printf '{"id":"123", "message":"hello"}\n' | nc -u -w 1 127.0.0.1 9999

sends a hello message to all browsers. Any message will be sent to all pages with 
the given id.

printf '{"id":"*", "message":"hello"}\n' | nc -u -w 1 127.0.0.1 9999
will send all connected browsers.
